Chelsea Player Ratings vs. Benfica: Own Goal Lifts Blues Over Mourinho in 1–0 Win

Chelsea secured a narrow 1-0 victory over Benfica in a tightly contested Champions League match at Stamford Bridge. The decisive moment came in the 67th minute when a Chelsea cross was deflected into the Benfica net by their own defender, handing the Blues a crucial three points.

The match was a tactical battle between two experienced managers, with Chelsea's manager pitted against former Blues boss Jose Mourinho, now in charge of the Portuguese side. Both teams created chances throughout the match, but defensive solidity was the order of the day.

Chelsea goalkeeper Edouard Mendy was largely untested but made a crucial save in the 85th minute to preserve the lead. The defense, marshaled by Thiago Silva, remained composed under pressure, limiting Benfica to few clear-cut opportunities.

In midfield, Jorginho controlled the tempo effectively, while Mason Mount provided creative sparks going forward. The attack struggled to find rhythm, but the own goal proved sufficient to secure victory.

The win puts Chelsea in a strong position in their Champions League group, while Benfica will rue the unfortunate deflection that cost them at least a point. Mourinho's return to Stamford Bridge ended in disappointment, though his team showed resilience and tactical discipline throughout the match.

Player Ratings:
Mendy (7/10) - Solid when called upon, made one important save
Silva (8/10) - Commanding presence at the back, excellent positioning
Jorginho (7/10) - Controlled midfield, kept possession well
Mount (6/10) - Worked hard but struggled to create clear chances
Forward line (5/10) - Lacked cutting edge in front of goal

The victory demonstrates Chelsea's ability to grind out results even when not playing at their best, a quality that will serve them well in the knockout stages.
